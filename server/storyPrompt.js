COORDINATE GUIDELINES:
- In AR camera coordinates:
  - x: horizontal position (-1.0 left to +1.0 right)
  - y: height from floor (0 is ground floor, 0.5 is flying/floating)
  - z: depth into room (-1.0 near to -2.5 far)
- Generate 3 to 5 scenes per story.
- Duration should be between 5 to 10 seconds per scene.
- Every scene should have clear character actions and expressive dialogue or narration.
- Ensure all characterIds in actions and dialogue match characters in the characters array.
- ONLY output the JSON object.`;
